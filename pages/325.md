### 📘 Rule 5(6): **How the Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) Works**

> The Ministry may refer complaints to an **IDC**, which can examine content-related complaints and recommend action.

✅ *Hinglish:*
Agar kisi content par serious complaint hoti hai — jise publisher ya self-body solve nahi kar paayi — toh Ministry:

➡️ Ek **Inter-Departmental Committee** (IDC) ko complaint bhej sakti hai.
➡️ IDC content ka review karega, aur suggest karega kya karna chahiye (modify, delete, warning, etc.)

---

### 🔹 IDC Can Recommend:

* Apology from the publisher
* Warning or disclaimer
* Content modification
* Full removal or blocking under Section 69A of IT Act (through Rule 16)

---

### ✅ Example:

A controversial OTT show (e.g., hurting religious sentiments) is not resolved via Netflix or its self-body.

➡️ Ministry refers it to IDC
➡️ IDC holds hearings (publisher ko sunta hai)
➡️ IDC recommends deletion or disclaimer
➡️ Ministry accepts and issues official order

---

### 🚨 Rule 5(7): **Emergency Blocking in Public Interest (Rule 16 Reference)**

> If content poses **grave threat** to public order, India’s sovereignty, or national security — the **Secretary of I\&B Ministry** can issue **interim blocking orders** without prior hearing.

✅ *Hinglish:*
Agar content itna sensitive ho ki **immediate action lena pade** (e.g., terrorism, riots, fake news), toh:

* Ministry ke Secretary **turant content block karne ka order de sakte hain**
* Bina hearing ke
* Baad mein IDC hearing karega (within 48 hours) to confirm action

---

### ⚠️ Use Case Examples:

* Fake news video inciting riots on YouTube
* Deepfake content targeting a community
* Terrorist propaganda on an OTT documentary

## ✅ **Ek Line Mein Overview**

📌 **Page 325:**
👉 *Yeh page batata hai ki agar complaint bahut serious ho ya urgent action chahiye ho, toh Ministry IDC ke through ya emergency powers se content ko review, modify ya block kar sakti hai — public safety, national security, aur legal compliance ke liye.*

This gives the government **final but controlled authority** over digital content, especially when urgent.
