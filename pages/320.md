We are now covering **Rule 3(2)(g), (h), and (i)** — which are very user-focused.

### 📘 Rule 3(2)(g): **Giving Users Control Over Content Visibility**

> SSMIs must provide users with **tools** to control who can see their content and who can interact with them.

✅ *Hinglish:*
Platform par har user ko yeh setting milni chahiye:

* Kaun unka content dekh sakta hai (e.g., public, friends only)
* Kaun unse contact kar sakta hai (e.g., messages, tags, comments)

✅ *Example:*

* Instagram gives option: "Allow messages from followers only"
* Facebook allows: “Make this post visible to: Friends / Public / Only Me”

---

### 📘 Rule 3(2)(h): **Notice Before Content Action**

> If the platform removes or disables user content (due to violation), it must **inform the user**, give **reasons**, and allow the user to **appeal** or **dispute** the decision.

✅ *Hinglish:*
Agar platform kisi user ka content delete karta hai (jaise post, video, tweet), toh:

1. User ko batana hoga
2. Kyun hataya, woh reason dena hoga
3. User ko appeal ka option dena hoga

✅ *Example:*
YouTube removes a video → sends email: “Your video violated our hate speech policy. You may appeal here.”

---

### 📘 Rule 3(2)(i): **Automated Tools for Identifying Harmful Content**

> Platforms must **develop automated tools** using tech like AI to identify:

* Child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
* Rape content
* Deepfakes
* Content violating Rule 3(1)(b)

✅ *Hinglish:*
Platform ko **automated technology (AI tools)** develop karni hogi jo:

* Offensive ya illegal content ko detect kare
* Jaise: nudity, sexual abuse, deepfake videos, hate speech, etc.

✅ *Example:*
Facebook AI automatically flags nude images or fake news before anyone reports them.
