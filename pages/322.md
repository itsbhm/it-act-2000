## 📄 **PAGE 322**

Continuing from Rule 4 (started on page 321), this page:

* Clarifies how the **Grievance Appellate Committee (GAC)** will function
* Defines how **Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMIs)** must **comply with its orders**
* Brings accountability to final step of grievance redressal

---

### 📘 Rule 4(3): **Implementation of GAC Orders**

> Platforms must **comply with every order** passed by the **Grievance Appellate Committee**.

✅ *Hinglish:*
Agar GAC koi final decision leta hai (maan lo user ka post wapas lagana hai), toh **platform ko us decision ko maan-na padega** — bina delay ke.

✅ *Example:*

* GAC ne bola: “User ka content galat tareeke se delete hua tha”
  → Twitter ko wo content **dubara restore** karna padega.

---

### 📘 Rule 4(4): **Timeline for Implementation**

> Platforms must **implement the GAC order within the timeline mentioned** in that order.

✅ *Hinglish:*
GAC bolta hai: “3 din mein post wapas lagao”
→ Platform ko **us time limit ke andar hi kaam karna hoga**

---

### 🔍 Purpose of Rule 4(3) & (4):

* Platform ko **final accountability** ke liye force karta hai
* User rights ko **legally enforceable** banata hai
* Govt-backed system ensure karta hai ki user complaints **properly heard ho**

## 💡 Summary Table

| Clause | Provision             | Hinglish                      |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 4(3)   | Follow GAC’s decision | Platform must obey GAC ruling |
| 4(4)   | Follow it in time     | Follow deadline given by GAC  |

---

### 🧩 Practical Example:

User's video on YouTube is taken down unfairly →
User appeals to GAC →
GAC says “reinstate the video within 72 hours” →
YouTube must **follow within 72 hours**, else it's **non-compliance** with IT Rules

## ✅ **Ek Line Mein Saar**

📌 **Page 322:**
👉 *Yeh page clarify karta hai ki agar Grievance Appellate Committee koi order pass karti hai, toh platform ko use strictly follow karna hoga aur diye gaye samay ke andar action lena hoga.*

---

This completes the **grievance appeal structure** for users — and makes sure platforms don’t ignore final authority.
